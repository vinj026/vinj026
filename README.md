This is where I build things, share experiments, and sometimes break stuff ğŸ¤­

ğŸ”­  Currently working on some small but meaningful projects  
ğŸŒ±  Learning more about Vue.js, API integration, and making things cleaner  
ğŸ’¬  Open to chat about anything related to JavaScript, Vue, or just building stuff in general  
ğŸ§©  I like exploring how small tools can solve real-world problems  
âš¡  Fun fact: I enjoy quiet work sessions with lo-fi music and good coffee
